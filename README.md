# athens üçÑ

Athens is an application (using [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books)) where users can search for books, and create an account to save books to their reading list! üìö

For this project, I used a functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server- making the application more performant. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

## Run Locally

1. Clone the repository

2. Install packages

```
npm i
```

3. Start the Development Server

```
npm run develop
```

## Process

To complete this project, I-

- Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
- Modified the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
- Created an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
